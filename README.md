# Team Summary Builder

### Author: mjb527

## Description

This app is run through the command line and uses Node.js's Inquirer and File System libraries to create a webpage that includes the team name, each employee's name, email, and employee ID number. Employees can be a manager, an engineer, or an intern. Included information will be the manager's office number, each engineer's Github username, and each intern's school.

After retrieving the data for each team member, the app will organize it into HTML and place the file in an output folder.
